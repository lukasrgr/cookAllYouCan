# cook_all_you_can
## Basics

"Cook All You Can" resembles a cook book app, that includes features from creating and updating recipes to be able to organize your meals and get an auto generated shopping list.
Main goal was to create a app with flutter without having to build a backend. For this purpose the Supabase (Firebase cost free alternative) with its integrated postgres database was used.
